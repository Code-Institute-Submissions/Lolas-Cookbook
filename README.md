Lola’s Cookbook - Recipe Manager
---------------------------------------
**Data Centric Development - Marjolein van Leeuwen**

This is my Data Centric Development project. 
I created Lola’s Cookbook to store my family’s recipes and created a login for users who would like to share their recipes with eachother.  I have called it Lola’s cookbook, because we always called my mother Lola and she had a real talent in Filipino cooking. 
And I wanted to store and share her recipes with others.

This project was developed using GitHub, MongoDB en Heroku
Proces:

Step 1
I created my database with MongoDB Atlas. I wanted to  first get my data in place and start building my application around it.  I created a database called: Filipino_Recipes. I added collections and inserted documents to create my first Filipino Recipe: Chicken Adobo.

Step 2
Created a Flask Application
I made a new repository in github and installed Flask in my gitpod repository with: pip3 install flask

Step 3
Created a new python file: app.py
Import Flask functionality and created flask app.

Step 4: 
Creating Heroku app and created connection with gitpod
Created requirements.txt
Created Procfile

Step 5:
Run the application in Heroku with command: heroku ps:scale web=1
Specify IP adress and PORT in settings in Heroku.
IP: 0.0.0.0
PORT: 5000
I succesfully deployed app! :)

Step 6: 
Connected Flask to MongoDB Atlas
Installed PyMongo: pip3 install flask-pymongo
Installed: pip3 install dnspython

Step 7: 
Created a base.html and recipes.html in templates folder. 
I used jinja blocks to inject content with {% block content %} insert content here {% endblock %}
